# TermS!gnal 📡

> A modern macOS terminal for BBSes. Something that works very well for ANSI art, smooth door game rendering, and retro soul.

## 🎯 The Problem

Modern terminals (Terminal.app, iTerm2) fail at rendering classic BBS experiences:
- ANSI art flickers or colors are wrong
- Door games like *Legend of the Red Dragon* don’t work right
- No support for CP437, proper cursor control, or BBS-specific terminal types

We deserve better.

## ✨ The Vision

I envision TermS!gnal to be a macOS terminal app that:
- Renders ANSI/ASCII art **perfectly** (with bundled CP437 font)
- Runs door games smoothly (LOTR, Trade Wars, etc.)
- Connects via SSH/Telnet with custom ports
- Has a clean, modern UI with retro flair
- Is easy to use, but can also use Terminal commands when needed

## 🧩 Features (Planned)
- [ ] CP437 font rendering (bundled)
- [ ] Full ANSI/VT100/AVT1 escape sequence support
- [ ] Configurable `TERM` variable (`ansi-bbs`, `avt1`, etc.)
- [ ] Smooth screen updates (no flicker)
- [ ] Keyboard mapping (F1-F12, arrow keys, etc.)
- [ ] BBS directory with one-click connect
- [ ] Session recording (.ans files)

## 🤝 Want to Help?

I’m not a developer, but I believe in this idea.

If you’re a macOS developer, terminal nerd, or retro computing fan **let’s build this together**.

Open an issue, comment, or DM me. All contributions welcome.


## 📣 Shout-Outs

This project was born from late-night BBS sessions, and a few special systems that still make the terminal glow feel magical.

These aren’t the only great BBSes out there... but they’re the ones I keep coming back to:

- **[TW Lounge](telnet://twlounge.ddns.net:7777)**
- **[Constructive Chaos](https://conchaos.synchro.net)**
- **[Last Rangers’](telnet://lastrangersbbs.com:8888)**
- **[xibalba.l33t.codes](ssh://xibalba.l33t.codes:44511)**
  
If you’re on a BBS in 2026, you’re not just nostalgic – you’re keeping a world alive.

Keep typ!ng.
